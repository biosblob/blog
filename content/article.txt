One thing I most certainly remember during my childhood was the quiet times I frequently would have. You see, I never wanted to hang out, watch movies, or go to social events with friends. I never wanted nor had birthday parties. I would have hours and hours to think, and I enjoyed it. My parents got worried-some and started to send me to this school counselor. Their silly analysis concluded that I was an 'extreme introvert' that would _never_ be equipped with the necessary social skills to be 'successful'. I still didn't get why be alone was a bad thing. If I wanted to socialize with others, I could at ease, but I just didn't want to. While I grew up with this conception, I started doing more and more things on my own. It felt healthy, uplifting, and I loved it. I mean, I had no one to impress and I could just be **myself**. No discrimination nor hurt would come across me, just brilliant ideas.
